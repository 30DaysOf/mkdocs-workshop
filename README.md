# 30DaysOf MkDocs

## Objective

Create a template repo that can be used for rapidly scaffolding 30DaysOf projects with [mkdocs-material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material).


## Motivation

Mkdocs-material provides a number of built-in or plugin-based features that check a lot of requirements for 30DaysOf projects. These include:

1. Rich components & styling (with Material Design)
1. Dark/Light Mode
1. Built-in Search
1. Markdown-based Content (with enhanced support)
1. Plugin-based Extensions (for rich integrations)
1. Built-in Cookie Consent (for Google Analytics)
1. Customizable navigation & default overrides
1. Support for Blog feature (via plugin)
1. Deployment to GitHub Pages (with GitHub Actions)
1. Python-based package (local preview, devcontainer support)

## Usage

The best way to use this template is:

1. Instantiate it (using the `Use this template` feature)
1. Read through the sample workshop (source in `docs/01-Workshop`)
1. Use it to create your own materials (e.g., as `docs/` subfolder)
1. Delete the `docs/01-Workshop` subfolder to remove the tutorial.
1. Commit changes and activate your default GitHub Pages settings in repo.

The next time you commit code, the GitHub Pages hosted endpoint should get rebuilt and redeployed automatically.
